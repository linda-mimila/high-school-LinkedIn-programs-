				<li> First, you have to get all the ingredients. Which will be tortillas, chicken, Chile verdes, cilantro, and tomatillos. 
				<li> Then, you get the tomatillos and chile verdes and let them sit in 		
				<li> After it's all over we get lunch my favorite part of the day. We all eat and share some laughs. If we have time then we either go to the game room or back to our office or maybe just chill. </li>
