		<h1 style="color:DarkGray;">fun facts about me </h1> 
			<p>
				I love watching and playing soccer. I did folkorico for 2 plus years and danced other type of music. I like going on adventures and trying new stuff even if I struggle. First comes my education and family. I want to achieve my goals that I have in order to have a good future. My weekends consist of having fun memories with my family like going to my little brothers soccer games, having carne asadas, and just staying home and watching movies.
